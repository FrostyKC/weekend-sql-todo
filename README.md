# To-Do List

## Description

Created an input field where the user can enter in a task, up to 240 characters, and click add task button to submit the task to the table. The table shows all the tasks submitted and if the task was completed or not. When the task added was completed the user can click "complete" under the update column. The task will then highlight in green, change the completed status to "Yes", and the task will move to the bottom of the list. If the user wants to change a completed task to uncompleted they can click the "Uncomplete" button under the update column, once clicked the task will no longer be highlighted in green, the completed status will change to "No", and the task will move to the bottom of all the uncompleted tasks. There is also a delete button that when clicked will remove the task entirely.
